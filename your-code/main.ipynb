    "Learn and apply different prompting techniques to improve the performance of a language model in generating customer support responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working for a company that provides a variety of services, including technical support, billing inquiries, and general customer service. Your task is to use a language model to automate responses to customer emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the FAQ of a company to do this exercise. Below you have a couple of examples, but feel free to find your own:\n",
